## Introduction to the Manual

Congratulations! You are approaching the last step toward attainment of your graduate degree. Your Master's thesis or Ph.D. dissertation is the permanent scholarly statement of your research.

This manual describes the requirements for formatting your manuscript, as established by UCIâ€™s Graduate Division, the Graduate Council of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, and the University Libraries. You are responsible for submitting a manuscript that complies with the formatting requirements of this manual, and is free of errors.

It is important that you work with your thesis/dissertation committee and/or your department to develop your manuscript. You and your committee are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the scholarly content in your manuscript. This manual only describes the manuscript formatting requirements to ensure a uniform presentation format of UCI theses and dissertations in ProQuest. For all other matters of organization, presentation, and documentation, your manuscript should meet the standards for published journal articles or monographs in your field.

Students are strongly encouraged to submit their thesis or dissertation electronically via the ProQuest Electronic Theses and Dissertation (ETD) system. Students may request to submit a thesis or dissertation in paper format by sending an email to gradthesis@uci.edu at least two weeks prior to the filing deadline.

Once your manuscript has been accepted by UCI Libraries, through ProQuest or in paper, no changes to the text or substitutions of pages may be made.
