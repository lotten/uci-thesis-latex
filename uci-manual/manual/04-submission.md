## How to Submit Your Manuscript

You have two options for submitting your manuscript to the UCI Libraries: electronic and paper. Electronic submission is highly encouraged.

(!)PLEASE NOTE: there is no way of making your submitted manuscript "dark"; regardless of if you submit your manuscript on paper to the Archives, or electronically toProQuest, your manuscript will be discoverable to researchers. If you have questions or concerns, please emailgradthesis@uci.edu

(!)COVID-19 NOTE(!)

The submission process is slightly altered due to the pandemic. If you are submitting your manuscript electronically (recommended), the submission process with the Libraries is exactly the same: you submit to ProQuest and wait for the acceptance email from the Libraries. Once you have the acceptance email, all of your forms are submitted via email to Graduate Division (grad@uci.edu).

If you are planning to submit a paper version of your manuscript, please email gradthesis@uci.edu.

## Electronic Submission

Electronic submission of your manuscript is done through ProQuest. The acceptance email that you must print out as part of your final degree paperwork will be sent from the UCI Libraries via the ProQuest system.

(Optional) Complete a Pre-Submission Critique. These are available to all graduate students up to one week before the filing deadline. During a critique, you can have your manuscript formatting looked over by a UCI Libraries staff member to ensure all of your formatting is up to publication standard. If you choose not to have a Pre-Submission Critique, your manuscript on ProQuest may be accepted "as-is."

If you'd like a Pre-Submission Critique, you can request one up to seven days before the filing deadline by:​

Uploading your manuscript to this form, or

Emailing a PDF of your manuscript to gradthesis@uci.edu

		

Create an account in ProQuest.Be sure that you are on the UCI ProQuestpage and complete all fields. Be sure that the email address you use to create your ProQuest account is one which you frequently check. This will be the address to which your Acceptance email (and all other communication) will be sent.

	

Upload your document(s). Your manuscript must be in portable document format (PDF) when you upload. You have the option of uploading your copyright letters and any potential supplemental materials (e.g., .mp3 files) as well.

	

Wait.Once you upload and submit your manuscript, you will receive a confirmation email from ProQuest letting you know that your submission went through. This isnotyour Acceptance email. Within 48 business hours of your submission, you will receive an email from ProQuest. This will either be your Acceptance email (at which point, your submission process is complete), or will be an email that is requesting changes to your manuscript be made. If you must make changes, your updated resubmission is subject to the same 48 business hour wait time.

	

Print your Acceptance email. Once you receive your Acceptance email, print it out. This printed email becomes part of your final paperwork packet that must be turned in to Graduate Division.

	If your ProQuestaccount says that your manuscript has been accepted, but you did not receive the email, double check that you are looking in the correct email account (e.g., if you create your ProQuest account with a Gmail address, all of your ProQuest communication will be sent to your Gmail account, not to your UCI email), and check the spam folders. If you still cannot find your email, send your request to gradthesis@uci.edu.

	

Turn in your paperwork.Your final paperwork must be accepted and date-stamped by someone from Graduate Division by end-of-day on the Filing Deadline. Failure to meet this deadline may result in your degree being delayed one (or more) terms. Turn in all paperwork (with original signatures) to Grad Division at 120 Aldrich Hall.
