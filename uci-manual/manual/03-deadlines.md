## Filing Deadlines

Deadlines are published on the Graduate Divisionâ€™s Filing Deadlines page. These official deadlines are final, and they usually occur at the end of the tenth week of classes. You must have passed your defense in order to submit your manuscript. If your thesis/dissertation defense is scheduled within 48 hours of the filing deadline, we strongly recommend that you contact gradthesis@uci.edu ahead of your defense in order to ensure that your thesis is approved on time.

All paperwork must be received by the end of the business day on the filing deadline. If you miss the deadline, the formal conferral of your degree will be delayed until (at minimum) the following quarter. The UCI Libraries is not authorized to approve extensions.

(!)PLEASE NOTE: a copy of your Acceptance Email (or a signed Manuscript Submission Form, if you submit a paper copy of your manuscript) is part of your final paperwork packet.Do not wait until the deadline day to submit your manuscript to the UCI Libraries!
