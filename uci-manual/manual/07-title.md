## Title Page

Your Title Page should include:

Author's name

	

Degree earned - use "official title" and wording provided by UCI Graduate Division

	

Full name and rank of each committee member- e.g., use "Associate Professor Peter Anteater" vs. "Prof. Anteater, PhD"

	

A search-friendly title - the words used in the title of your manuscript are the access points for researchers who may use keyword-searching techniques to identify works in various subject areas. Use word substitutes, not symbols or formulas, to ensure effective retrieval from on-line indexes. Use concise titles containing words descriptive of the work; emphasis should be on nouns, with easily identifiable key words.
