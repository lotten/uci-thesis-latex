## Your Responsibilities as a Candidate

To maintain your status as a graduate degree candidate, you must continue your full-time enrollment as a UCI student until your thesis/dissertation has been approved by your faculty committee and accepted by UCI Libraries. If your student status lapses, so does your candidate status. To maintain your full-time enrollment, you must pay either the quarterly Registration Fee and enroll in a minimum of 12 units or, in certain cases, pay a Filing Fee.

When creating your thesis/dissertation manuscript, you must follow the formatting guidelines outlined in this Manual. Students are wholly responsible for ensuring that their manuscript adheres to all requirements specified in this Manual.

## Filing Fee

You may pay a Filing Fee instead of the regular quarterly Registration Fee or Summer Session Fee if, prior to the beginning of the term in which you expect to receive your degree, you have met all degree requirements, as well as all other eligibility requirements for the filing fee which are listed on the form.

The Filing Fee is half the amount of the Registration Fee. To pay the Filing Fee, you must have the chair of your thesis/dissertation committee sign a Filing Fee Petition form, which is available from your department or the Graduate Division. The form must also be signed by your Department Chair or Graduate Advisor. Students in the Schools of Biological Sciences, Engineering, Humanities, Social Ecology, Social Sciences and ICS also need their Associate Dean's signature on the petition form. International students must have approval from the International Center before submitting their form.

Once your petition has all the required signatures, take it to the Cashier's Office (228 Aldrich Hall) and pay the Filing Fee by the deadline, and then submit the signed petition to the Graduate Division (120 Aldrich Hall).

If your Filing Fee petition is not approved, you must continue to enroll and pay the full Registration Fee until you have completed all your degree requirements.

## Follow the Formatting Requirements in this Manual

The requirements in this manual pertain to manuscript formatting, manuscript submission, and copyright matters. They take precedence over any style manuals used by your academic discipline or adopted by your committee. Please ensure that you are using the most current version of the manual, as previous versions of the manual may be out of date and not valid.

(!)PLEASE NOTE:Students are responsible for adherence to all requirements specified in this Manual.

Do not rely principally on the format of another student's thesis/dissertation when preparing your own manuscript.

Your manuscript must be submitted in Adobe PDF format.

We maintain a Word template that conforms to all formatting requirements. Templates for Ph.D. and Masters theses can be found on the UCI Libraries Theses and Dissertations templates page.

UCI does not maintain an official LaTeX template. However, the following template is accurate as of December 2013: https://github.com/lotten/uci-thesis-latex. If you are using a LaTeX template, please check to see that it conforms to the current Word template that we maintain.

The Graduate Division and the UCI Libraries conduct quarterly workshops on the preparation and filing of theses and dissertations. You are strongly urged to attend; dates and times of future sessions are available on the UCI Libraries Theses & Dissertation page.
