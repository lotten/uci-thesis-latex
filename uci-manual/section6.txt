UCI Theses and Dissertations Manual - 6. Electronic Doctoral Dissertation and Master's Thesis Submission Procedures

6.1. Submitting Electronically the Doctoral Dissertation or Master's Thesis

UCI allows Doctoral students and Master students to submit their dissertation or thesis electronically via the UMI ETD system. All required and optional paper forms need to be submitted to the Graduate Division, 120 Aldrich Hall by the submission deadline. 
Electronic submissions of a doctoral dissertation or master's thesis must follow all formatting requirements set forth in the manual.  It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis appears as originally intended when it is accessed or printed. An original Ph.D. Form II/Signature page or Master's thesis/Signature page, with committee signatures and other signatures (as appropriate) must be submitted to the Graduate Division with all other final degree paperwork. The manuscript submitted electronically (ETD), should not include a signature page.
The doctoral dissertation or master's thesis must be submitted as a single electronic Portable Document Format (PDF) file. If the original doctoral dissertation or master's thesis is a Microsoft Word or RTF file, you will be able to convert the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis to a PDF at the UCI Dissertation Submission Site. If the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis is not in Microsoft Word, RTF or PDF - e.g. LaTeX or WordPerfect - it must be converted to PDF before the student uses the Submission Site. Certain types of fonts and graphics work better with PDF, and special attention should be paid to creating equations for PDF conversion. Optional supplemental files (images, video, audio) that are an integral part of the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis but not part of the full text may also be submitted electronically, upon approval of your committee.

6.1. Submitting Electronically the Doctoral Dissertation or Master's Thesis

Electronic doctoral dissertations and master's theses must be submitted via the UCI ETD Dissertation Submission Site.
When the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis is ready to be submitted, students click on "Submit Your Dissertation/Thesis" in the left sidebar. This link opens the log-in page for students to click on the "New user" link to create a free account. If an account has already been created, students enter the appropriate email address and password into the text boxes provided and click "Log-In." If you are submitting a revision, use the revise dissertation link in the email from sent to you from the reviewer; do not create a new account.
Once the log-in is successful, students follow the instructions and links. In addition to properly formatting your doctoral dissertation or master's thesis, you will need to choose one of four publishing options. Please see the options site for details on the four options and discuss them with your committee chair. Current UC
Irvine policy requires immediate release of doctoral dissertations and master's theses. If your committee chair wishes to delay publication with an embargo, s/he must complete the embargo section of the Ph.D. Form II/Signature page and attach a brief memo of explanation addressed to the Graduate Dean. Options for the period of time an embargo may be granted are: 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. The letter must also be endorsed by the chair of your department. The student's acceptance of the Submission Agreement and ProQuest Release is required in order to submit the electronic doctoral dissertation or master's thesis. These agreements contain standard language that is also part of the paper contract that one would sign while filing a paper doctoral dissertation or master's thesis. Students click on "Accept" to agree to these terms.
Next, students complete the required text boxes with student name and contact information and click "Continue."
The next page requires information about the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis and student's degree. Students paste or type the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis abstract into the appropriate text box. Finally, students indicate whether ProQuest is authorized to register the student's claim to copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office for a $65 fee. Once students click on "Submit," the next page may take a few minutes to load.
The next page is an optional order form for printed, bound copies of the doctoral dissertation or master's thesis. To place an order, students complete the relevant fields and click on "Place order." Otherwise, students may click on "Continue without ordering copies."
The final page gives students the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the submission. If the submission is satisfactory, students click on "Log out."
An email confirmation of a successfully submitted electronic doctoral dissertation
or master's thesis will be sent to students. A printed copy of this email needs to be submitted to the Graduate Division, along with all other forms. The electronic doctoral dissertation or master's thesis will be sent to the Library Archives for final approval. Upon review of the electronic doctoral dissertation or master's thesis, the Library Archives will send an email to students with any problems or questions prior to the final approval. Students will need to submit required corresponding forms, to the Graduate Division, Aldrich Hall 120, once they have submitted their thesis or dissertations electronically.
