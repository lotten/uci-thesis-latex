5.4. Publishing Your Work Elsewhere and Embargoes 
If you plan to publish your work elsewhere, when you submit your manuscript via the ETD system you can request that ProQuest withhold your manuscript for a period of 6 months, 1 year or 2 years from your date of submission. This is requesting an embargo, and it means that your manuscript will be neither cataloged for the UC Irvine Libraries collection nor published by UMI ProQuest in their databases until after the embargo period concludes. Current UC Irvine policy requires immediate release of doctoral dissertations and master's theses. If your committee chair wishes to delay publication with an embargo, s/he must complete the embargo section of the Ph.D. Form II/Signature page (or Master's Thesis Signature page). Options for the period of time an embargo may be granted are: 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. The letter must also be endorsed by the chair of your department. If you are submitting your dissertation electronically, the ETD system provides you with the options of requesting an embargo of 6 months, 1 year or 2 years.
