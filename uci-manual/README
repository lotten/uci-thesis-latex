This directory contains the UCI thesis manual used to develop this latex
template. As the manual changes, the template must be updated to match.
The scripts in this directory make it easy to download the most recent
manual from UCI's web site and identify any differences from the version
implemented by this template.

DEPENDENCIES

Python 2.7 (tested with 2.7.3)
BeautifulSoup4 (tested with 4.1.3)

PROCEDURE TO UPDATE THE MANUAL AND TEMPLATE

1. ./scrape_manual.py
   
   This will download and parse the most recent version of the manual
   from UCI's website.

2. git diff *.txt

   This will report any differences between the newly downloaded manual
   and the last one stored in the repository. The next steps depend on
   the result of this diff.

   * If there are no differences:
   
     You are done. The template is already up-to-date.

   * If there are minor differences that do not affect the actual requirements:

     The template is still up-to-date, but you should update the repository to
     save other users effort in the future. To do this:
     - Commit the modified .txt files.
     - Submit a pull request on GitHub.

   * If there are differences that affect the requirements:

     The template may need updating. To help keep it up-to-date:
     - Create an Issue on GitHub describing any changes that need to be made
       to the template.
     If you'd like to update the template yourself:
     - Commit the modified .txt files.
     - Update the latex template and commit the changes.
     - Submit a pull request on GitHub.
